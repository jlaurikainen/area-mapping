### About

A portfolio project using Vue. The inspiration for the project came for working on creating a campus map for LAB/LUAS. The map was supposed to use an existing zoning plan as a base for drawing parking lots. But the construction of the parking lots had not progressed as far as intended. So I had to manually map the existing parking lots using a mobile app that drew a line as I walked the lots based on GPS position. The quality of the line draw by GPS was awful. I figured a better approach for drawing areas the way I needed might be to let the user add points manually on specific locations based on GPS position instead. I never did get to use the app in action, but it did get me a job.
